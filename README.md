#### About me
:beginner: I'm more into Machine Learning than anything else :skull:  
:poultry_leg: Making cool stuff and forcing people to say the word, "Wow", that's what I do! People generally love the stuff I make.  
:sweat_smile: Pursuing BTech in CSE at VIT (2nd year) 
:wink: I'm not only a programmer, but a music lover and weeb too. You guys should try my [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2loIBh5753F17YqHufCY95?si=02312e3fb0db43c7), and checkout my [animelist](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/wackyEsper). Also, I think every programmer is a nature lover like me and I am not the only one who loves listening to rain sounds and rain music while coding.

#### Skills, languages and tools
I use libraries like **Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seabron, Scikit-learn**, to do stuff like EDA, and creating machine learning models.  
As you all know, I'm primarily a python developer, but I also know c, c++ and java. Here's a fun fact, I first learned java, and then after that I learned c++ XD.   
 
~ My message for every programmer out there - Keep creating cool stuff :moyai:
